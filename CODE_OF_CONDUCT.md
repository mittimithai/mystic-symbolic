## Mystic Symbolic Code of Conduct

Our primary aim is to create a cool, functioning Visionary Art Generator. 

To that end, we value contributions from anyone, regardless of social skills, opinions, sex, race, ethnicity, national origin, culture, appearance, immigration status, class, sexual orientation, religion, gender expression, age, size, and unrelated abilities. 

You donâ€™t have to like or agree with anyone to contribute to this project. 
We judge contributions on their quality and functionality, regardless of who made them.

In all matters we prefer patience over impatience, friendliness over hostility, maturity over immaturity. 

Cultivate tolerance of disagreements and diverse viewpoints. 

In cases of hurt feelings and overstepping boundaries, recourse must be possible. 

If you make a mistake, please apologize. 

If you are offered an apology, please accept it. 
Evaluate your own behavior and apologize if you recognize your error, not because someone else is coercing you.

Do not harass other contributors. 

While what constitutes harassment remains a matter of case-by-case interpretation, we do not tolerate directing violent threats or language against another person, or posting sexually explicit or graphic violence.
